create a CLI app to check whether user’s birthday is a prime number.

Chalk to make it beautiful
Bonus (Optional): check the input type and show an error if user entered “potato” instead of a DD/MM format
give an error if DD is more than 31 or MM is more than 12
take it further and check the entire date for validity like 30/02 can never happen.
