     <h2 id="1-what-is-dom-">1. What is DOM?</h2>
     <p>DOM is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the page so that programs can change
          the
          document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects. That way,
          programming
          languages can connect to the page.</p>
     <h2 id="2-what-is-an-api-">2. What is an API?</h2>
     <p>An API is a set of functions and procedures that allow the creation of applications that access the features or
          data
          of an operating system, application, or other service.</p>
     <h2 id="3-what-is-semantic-html-">3. What is Semantic HTML?</h2>
     <p>Semantic HTML is the use of HTML markup to reinforce the semantics, or meaning, of the information in webpages
          rather
          than merely to define its presentation or look.</p>
     <h2 id="4-what-is-the-difference-between-inline-and-inline-block-">4. What is the difference between inline and
          inline-block?</h2>
     <p>Inline elements are elements that do not start on a new line and do not take up the full width available.
          Inline-block elements are elements that do not start on a new line but do take up the full width available.

     <h2 id="5-explain-about-promises-">5. Explain about promises.</h2>
     <ul>
          <li>A promise is an object that may produce a single value some time in the future: either a resolved value,
               or a
               reason that itâ€™s not resolved (e.g., a network error occurred). A promise may be in one of 3 possible
               states:
               fulfilled, rejected, or pending. Promise users can attach callbacks to handle the fulfilled value or the
               reason for rejection.</li>

     <h2 id="7-consequences-of-placing-script-tag-inside-head-">7. Consequences of placing script tag inside head.</h2>
     <p>Placing script tag inside head will cause the page to load slowly because the script will be loaded first before

          command
          (the fetch (URL). then (). then (). catch(err))</h2>
     <p>The fetch() method takes one mandatory argument, the path to the resource you want to fetch. It returns a
          promise
          that resolves to the Response to that request, whether it is successful or not. The promise is rejected if the
          fetch fails, for example because of a network error.</p>

     <p>Git is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files
          among
          multiple people. It is primarily used for source code management in software development, but it can be used
          to

     <p>GitHub is a web-based hosting service for version control using Git. It is mostly used for computer code. It

     <p>Branching is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time. By default your repository has
          one
          branch named master which is considered to be the definitive branch. We use branches to experiment and make
          edits
          before committing them to master.</p>

     <p>A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the
          outer
          function to complete some kind of routine or action. Curly braces are not added to it because it is a function
          expression.</p>

          20. Explain what is Git and its process or flow (from creating a repository to finally pushing and updating it
          through different commits online on GitHub)</h2>
     <p>Git is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files
          among
          multiple people. It is primarily used for source code management in software development, but it can be used
          to
          keep up with changes in any set of files. The process or flow of Git is as follows:</p>
     <ul>
          <li>Create a repository</li>
          <li>Clone the repository</li>
          <li>Add files to the staging area</li>
          <li>Commit the files</li>
          <li>Push the files to the remote repository</li>

     <p>CSS Variables are used to store the values of properties which are used repeatedly in the code. This helps in
          reducing the code size and also makes the code more readable. It also helps in making the code more dynamic
          and
          easy to change.</p>

          API.</h2>
     <p>Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. They are used to handle multiple asynchronous
          operations where callbacks can create callback hell leading to unmanageable code. A promise has 3 states:
          pending,
          fulfilled, rejected. A promise is created using the new Promise constructor which takes a function as its
          argument
          with two parameters resolve and reject. The resolve function is called when the promise is fulfilled and the
          reject
          function is called when the promise is rejected. The then() function is used to handle the fulfilled promise
          and
          the catch() function is used to handle the rejected promise.</p>

          tag

     <p>Placing the script tag at the bottom of the index.html file helps in loading the HTML file first and then the
          script
          file. This helps in reducing the loading time of the page.</p>

     <p>Yes, we can use any selector like id, class, tag name, etc.</p>
     <h2 id="25-difference-between-class-and-id-">25. Difference between class and id.</h2>
     <p>The class selector is used to select all the elements with the same class name whereas the id selector is used

          select a single element with a particular id.</p>
     <h2 id="26-speak-about-the-box-model-">26. Speak about the box model.</h2>
     <p>The box model is used to represent the HTML elements as boxes. It consists of the content, padding, border, and
          margin. The content is the actual content of the element. The padding is the space between the content and the
          border. The border is the border of the element. The margin is the space between the border and the adjacent
          element.</p>

     </h2>
     <p>Fetch is used to make HTTP requests in JavaScript. It is used to make asynchronous requests to the server. It
          returns
          a promise which is handled using the then() and catch() functions.</p>

          synchronous

     <p>JavaScript is asynchronous. It is a single-threaded language which means that it can only execute one task at a
          time.
          It uses an event loop to handle asynchronous operations.</p>

          Number of ways of using fetch: depending on the type of request - GET, POST, PUT. Can read more on MDN docs.
     </h2>
     <p>There are 4 ways of using fetch: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE. The GET method is used to retrieve data from the
          server. The
          POST method is used to send data to the server. The PUT method is used to update data on the server. The
          DELETE

     <p>The key is used to uniquely identify each element in the list. It is used by React to identify which items have
          changed, are added, or are removed.</p>
     <h2 id="32-use-of-typeof-in-the-code">32. Use of typeof in the code</h2>

     <p>The display property is used to specify whether an element should be visible or not. The visibility property is
          used
          to specify whether an element should be visible or not. The difference between the two is that the display
          property
          removes the element from the document flow whereas the visibility property keeps the element in the document
          flow
          but makes it invisible.</p>
