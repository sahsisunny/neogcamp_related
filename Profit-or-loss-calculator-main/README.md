# PROFIT OR LOSS CALCULATOR

- This is a simple profit or loss calculator made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- This is a part of my learning journey in web development.
- I have used HTML for the structure of the page, CSS for styling and JavaScript for the functionality.
- I have used the concept of DOM manipulation to get the values from the input fields and calculate the profit or loss.

## How to use?

- Enter the initial price of the stock.
- Enter the quantity of stocks.
- Enter the current price of the stock.
- Click on the button to check the profit or loss.
- The result will be displayed below the button.
